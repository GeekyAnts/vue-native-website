This page will help you install and build your first native app using [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/).

**System Requirements**
* Globally installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.0
* Globally installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 4.0
* Globally installed [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) which allow you to easily create and initialize projects.

## Setup with Vue Native Cli

[Vue Native Cli](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-cli) is the easiest way to start building a application using [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/).

Assuming that you have globally installed [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

** Step 1 Running The App **

```
npm install -g vue-native-cli
vue-native init <projectName> // Initializes crna project
vue-native init <projectName> --no-crna // Initializes react-native project
cd <project-name>
```

** Step 2 Running The App **

```
npm start

```
Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the --no-interactive flag.
Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io/) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

```
npm run ios

```

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

```
npm run android

```

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)) for detailed setup).


## Setup with React Native

** Step 1 Create React Native Project **

```
react-native init <projectName>
cd <projectName>
```

** Step 2 Install Vue Native**

```
npm install vue-native-core vue-native-helper --save
npm install vue-native-scripts --save-dev
```

** Step 3 Configure the React Native Packager**

Create `vueTransformerPlugin.js` file to your project's root and specify supported extensions(vue):

```js
// For React Native version 0.52 or later
var upstreamTransformer = require("metro/src/transformer");

// For React Native version 0.47-0.51
// var upstreamTransformer = require("metro-bundler/src/transformer");

// For React Native version 0.46
// var upstreamTransformer = require("metro-bundler/build/transformer");

var vueNativeScripts = require("vue-native-scripts");
var vueExtensions = ["vue"];

module.exports.transform = function({ src, filename, options }) {
  if (vueExtensions.some(ext => filename.endsWith("." + ext))) {
    return vueNativeScripts.transform({ src, filename, options });
  }
  return upstreamTransformer.transform({ src, filename, options });
};
```

Add this to your `rn-cli.config.js` (make one to your project's root if you don't have one already):

```js
module.exports = {
  getTransformModulePath() {
    return require.resolve("./vueTransformerPlugin.js");
  },
  getSourceExts() {
    return ["vue"];
  }
};
```

You've successfully setup [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) with your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. Now build truly native app which are ready to run on iOS and Android devices.

Check out the [KitchenSink Vue Native App](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/KitchenSink-Vue-Native) an example which demonstrate different usages of [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) and [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io).

** Step 4 Create A Vue File **
Remove the Content of the `App.js` file and rename `App.js` file with `App.vue`.

Now Copy and paste the below code:

```
<template>
  <view class="container">
    <text class="text-color-primary">My Vue Native App</text>
    </view>
</template>

<style>
.container {
  background-color: white;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex: 1;
}
.text-color-primary {
  color: blue;
}
</style>

```

** Step 5 Running The App **

```
react-native run-ios
```

 It will open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

```
react-native run-android
```

 It will open your app in the Android Emulator if you have properly setup android studio and emulator.
