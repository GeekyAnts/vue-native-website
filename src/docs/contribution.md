## Sending a Pull Request

The core team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. Weâ€™ll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1.  Fork the repository `git clone git@github.com:GeekyAnts/vue-native-core.git` and create your branch from master.
2.  Run npm install in the repository root.
3.  Create a sample app using vue-native-cli separately outside the project repository.

    - vue-native-template-compiler
