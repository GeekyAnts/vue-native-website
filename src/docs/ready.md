We've have briefly introduced the most basic features of Vue Native - we are making continuous efforts to improve our docs.
Since Vue Native connects React Native and Vue.js, you can also go through [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and [Vue.js Docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).
To implement state management using Vuex, you can also go through [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/).

If you want to use `vuex-persist` to persist your state, you can refer this [example](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-starter-app/tree/feat/dataPersistence).
