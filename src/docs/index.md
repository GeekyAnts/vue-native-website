## What is Vue Native?
Vue Native is a mobile framework to build truly native mobile app using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It is designed to connect [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) and Vue.js.

Vue Native is a wrapper around React Native APIs, which allows you to use Vue.js and compose rich mobile User Interface.

## What is Vue.js?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like **view**) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
